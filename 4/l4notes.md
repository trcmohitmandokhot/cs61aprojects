## Week 2 Lecture 4 - Higher Order Functions

### Lecture 4 Video 2 
Nothing

### Lecture 4 Video 3
Characteristics of Functions
- Domain: Set of all inputs as arguments
- Range: Scope of outputs
- Behavior I/O Mapping

Guide to designing good functions:
- Give function 1 job.
- Don't repeat yourself. Implement once. Execute many times.
- Define functions generally.

### Lecture 4 Video 4 - Higher Order Functions
When solving one problem, identify if similar closely related problems exist.  
Find commonality between problems.  
Find what makes each problem unique.  
Define arguments to accomodate general and specifics. *Generalizing over numbers/arguments*
Generalizing over computation processes is another approach of defining functions. 

**Assert statement**
```
assert r > 0, 'A radius must be positive'
```

### Lecture 4 Video 5 - FUNCTION TAKES ANOTHER FUNCTION AS AN ARGUMENT
Higher Order Function.  
A function that takes another function as an argument.  
This is quite powerful.

You can also create a function that can return a function  
This is also very powerful.  

**SUMMARY**
1) Functions can be used as arguments to another function. Functions can be returned as outputs from a function.
2) Higher-order function is one that does item 1
3) Such functions allow us to narrow down each function to do 1 thing. Remove repetition.
